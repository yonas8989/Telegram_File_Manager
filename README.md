# 🖼️ Image Collection Script for Sick Dataset

This PowerShell script is designed to **gather all image files** from multiple subdirectories (e.g., `Directory_1` to `Directory_16`) located in the `Sick` dataset folder and consolidate them into a single directory called `Sick_Collected`.

## 📁 Directory Structure

Dataset/
│
├── Sick/
│ ├── Directory_1/
│ ├── Directory_2/
│ ├── ...
│ └── Directory_16/
│
└── Sick_Collected/ <-- This will be created by the script if not already present

markdown
Copy
Edit

## 📜 Script Overview

- **Source Directory:**  
  `C:\Users\hp\OneDrive\Desktop\sebele_mihiretu_project\Dataset\Sick`

- **Destination Directory:**  
  `C:\Users\hp\OneDrive\Desktop\sebele_mihiretu_project\Dataset\Sick_Collected`

- **Supported Image Formats:**  
  `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.bmp`, `.gif`

## ✅ What the Script Does

1. **Checks if the destination folder exists** — creates it if not.
2. **Recursively searches** all subdirectories in the source path.
3. **Finds all image files** with supported extensions.
4. **Copies** them into the destination folder.
5. **Overwrites** existing files with the same name (`-Force`).

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open **PowerShell**.
2. Copy and paste the script into your PowerShell terminal or save it as `collect-images.ps1`.
3. Run the script.

> ⚠️ Make sure to run PowerShell with the necessary file access permissions.

## 🛠️ Notes

- If multiple files across different directories share the **same filename**, the script will overwrite them in the destination.
- Customize the `$sourceDir` and `$destinationDir` variables if your folder paths differ.

---

### 📌 Example Use Case

This script is useful when you're preparing a dataset for machine learning or deep learning training and need to organize all images into a flat structure.

how to ran the script command


ChatGPT said:
To run your PowerShell script, follow these steps:

1. Open PowerShell
Press Windows Key + X and select Windows PowerShell or Windows Terminal.

2. Allow Script Execution (If Needed)
By default, Windows may block the running of PowerShell scripts due to security settings. To enable script execution:

Type the following command in PowerShell:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
You'll be prompted to confirm. Type Y and hit Enter.

This allows scripts downloaded from the internet to run if they are signed, and lets local scripts run without a signature.

3. Navigate to the Folder Containing the Script
Use the cd (change directory) command to navigate to the folder where your script is located. For example:

powershell
Copy
Edit
cd "C:\path\to\your\script\folder"
Replace C:\path\to\your\script\folder with the actual path where your collect-images.ps1 file is stored.

4. Run the Script
Once you're in the correct folder, you can run the script by typing:

powershell
Copy
Edit
.\collect-images.ps1
The .\ tells PowerShell to run the script from the current directory.

5. Monitor the Output
After running the script, you should see a message saying:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
Images have been collected into C:\Users\hp\OneDrive\Desktop\sebele_mihiretu_project\Dataset\Sick_Collected
The images will be copied to the specified destination folder.

ChatGPT said:
Thanks for sharing the error. The message indicates that PowerShell can’t find the script file collect-images.ps1 in the current directory (C:\Users\hp\OneDrive\Desktop\File_Collector_Shell_Script).

Let’s troubleshoot and fix it:

✅ Step-by-Step Fix
1. Make Sure the Script File Exists in the Current Folder
Check if the file is actually named collect-images.ps1 and is saved in the folder:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
C:\Users\hp\OneDrive\Desktop\File_Collector_Shell_Script
You can confirm this by running:

powershell
Copy
Edit
dir
Look for collect-images.ps1 in the output. If it's not listed:

Double-check the file name and extension (make sure it's .ps1, not .txt).

If you're using Notepad, it may have saved it as collect-images.ps1.txt. You can rename it:

powershell
Copy
Edit
rename-item "collect-images.ps1.txt" "collect-images.ps1"
2. Try Running Again
If the script exists and is listed in the output of dir, run:

powershell
Copy
Edit
.\collect-images.ps1
3. Still Not Working? Check Execution Policy
Run this command to allow local script execution:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
Then try again:

powershell
Copy
Edit
.\collect-images.ps1
📝 Tip: Show File Extensions in Explorer (Optional)
To avoid confusion with file extensions:

Open File Explorer.

Click View > Show > File name extensions.

Let me know what you see after running dir in that folder, and I’ll guide you further if needed.

# 📂 Telegram Desktop Download Organizer

This Python script helps you **automatically organize files** from your Telegram Desktop download folder into categorized subfolders (e.g., Images, Videos, Documents) and groups them by the current **month and year**.

---

## 🧰 Features

✅ Categorizes files by type (e.g., Images, Videos, Documents, etc.)  
✅ Creates subfolders for the current month (e.g., `2025-06`)  
✅ Handles duplicate filenames gracefully  
✅ Skips directories and only processes files  
✅ Keeps the download folder clean and organized

---

## 📁 Directory Example (after running the script)

telegram Desktop/
│
├── Images/
│ └── 2025-06/
│ └── photo1.jpg
│
├── Documents/
│ └── 2025-06/
│ └── report.pdf
│
├── Audio/
│ └── 2025-06/
│ └── voice.ogg
│
├── Others/
│ └── 2025-06/
│ └── some_file.xyz

yaml
Copy
Edit

---

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

1. Scans the Telegram Desktop folder:
   ```python
   download_dir = r"C:\Users\hp\Downloads\telegram Desktop"
Detects file types based on extensions:

Images: .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.

Videos: .mp4, .mkv, etc.

Documents: .pdf, .docx, etc.

Audio: .mp3, .ogg, etc.

Archives: .zip, .rar, etc.

Others: Anything that doesn't fit above.

Creates category folders if they don’t exist, nested with the current month (e.g., 2025-06).

Moves files into the correct folder. If a file with the same name already exists, it renames the new one to avoid overwriting:

scss
Copy
Edit
filename(1).jpg, filename(2).jpg, ...
▶️ How to Run
Make sure Python is installed on your system.

Save the script as organize_telegram_downloads.py.

Open a terminal (or PowerShell) and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python organize_telegram_downloads.py
📎 Requirements
Python 3.x

No external dependencies (uses built-in os, shutil, datetime)

📝 Notes
You can change the download_dir path in the script to organize any folder.

The script safely skips subdirectories and only moves actual files.

It's ideal for periodic cleanup of your Telegram downloads folder.

Thanks for sharing the error. The message indicates that PowerShell can’t find the script file collect-images.ps1 in the current directory (C:\Users\hp\OneDrive\Desktop\File_Collector_Shell_Script).

Let’s troubleshoot and fix it:

✅ Step-by-Step Fix
1. Make Sure the Script File Exists in the Current Folder
Check if the file is actually named collect-images.ps1 and is saved in the folder:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
C:\Users\hp\OneDrive\Desktop\File_Collector_Shell_Script
You can confirm this by running:

powershell
Copy
Edit
dir
Look for collect-images.ps1 in the output. If it's not listed:

Double-check the file name and extension (make sure it's .ps1, not .txt).

If you're using Notepad, it may have saved it as collect-images.ps1.txt. You can rename it:

powershell
Copy
Edit
rename-item "collect-images.ps1.txt" "collect-images.ps1"
2. Try Running Again
If the script exists and is listed in the output of dir, run:

powershell
Copy
Edit
.\collect-images.ps1
3. Still Not Working? Check Execution Policy
Run this command to allow local script execution:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
Then try again:

powershell
Copy
Edit
.\collect-images.ps1
📝 Tip: Show File Extensions in Explorer (Optional)
To avoid confusion with file extensions:

Open File Explorer.

Click View > Show > File name extensions.

Let me know what you see after running dir in that folder, and I’ll guide you further if needed.

Here’s a README.md file explaining your Python script, which organizes downloaded files by type and date from your Telegram Desktop download folder:

# 📂 Telegram Desktop Download Organizer

This Python script helps you **automatically organize files** from your Telegram Desktop download folder into categorized subfolders (e.g., Images, Videos, Documents) and groups them by the current **month and year**.

---

## 🧰 Features

✅ Categorizes files by type (e.g., Images, Videos, Documents, etc.)  
✅ Creates subfolders for the current month (e.g., `2025-06`)  
✅ Handles duplicate filenames gracefully  
✅ Skips directories and only processes files  
✅ Keeps the download folder clean and organized

---

## 📁 Directory Example (after running the script)

telegram Desktop/
│
├── Images/
│ └── 2025-06/
│ └── photo1.jpg
│
├── Documents/
│ └── 2025-06/
│ └── report.pdf
│
├── Audio/
│ └── 2025-06/
│ └── voice.ogg
│
├── Others/
│ └── 2025-06/
│ └── some_file.xyz

yaml

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

1. Scans the Telegram Desktop folder:
   ```python
   download_dir = r"C:\Users\hp\Downloads\telegram Desktop"
Detects file types based on extensions:

Images: .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.

Videos: .mp4, .mkv, etc.

Documents: .pdf, .docx, etc.

Audio: .mp3, .ogg, etc.

Archives: .zip, .rar, etc.

Others: Anything that doesn't fit above.

Creates category folders if they don’t exist, nested with the current month (e.g., 2025-06).

Moves files into the correct folder. If a file with the same name already exists, it renames the new one to avoid overwriting:

scss
Copy
Edit
filename(1).jpg, filename(2).jpg, ...
▶️ How to Run
Make sure Python is installed on your system.

Save the script as organize_telegram_downloads.py.

Open a terminal (or PowerShell) and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python organize_telegram_downloads.py
📎 Requirements
Python 3.x

No external dependencies (uses built-in os, shutil, datetime)

📝 Notes
You can change the download_dir path in the script to organize any folder.

The script safely skips subdirectories and only moves actual files.

It's ideal for periodic cleanup of your Telegram downloads folder.
